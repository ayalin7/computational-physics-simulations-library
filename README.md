# Computational Physics Simulations Library

A public collection of computational physics simulations, numerical experiments, and physical system solvers developed primarily in Julia.

This repository focuses on the simulation and numerical study of physical phenomena across different areas of physics, combining theoretical documentation, computational implementations, and scientific visualizations.

The project is organized by physical systems rather than numerical methods. Each simulation includes:

* theoretical background,
* mathematical formulation,
* numerical implementation,
* and visual outputs such as plots, animations, and field maps.

# Objectives

The main goals of this repository are:

* Build a structured library of reusable computational physics projects.
* Provide clear and documented implementations of physical models.
* Connect theory, numerical methods, and visualization in a single framework.
* Serve as an educational and research-oriented resource.
* Create modular simulations that can interact with external numerical methods repositories and future projects.
